# UST CODE SECURITY ANALYSER

This AI-driven project uses GPT-4 and Azure OpenAI to identify and mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications, providing developers with an interactive platform for analyzing code, understanding risks, and implementing remediation strategies.

This app can effectively identify and address the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. The complexity and variety of web application vulnerabilities and the need for accuracy and efficiency make this project suitable for AI.
The GPT-4 model and Azure OpenAI service were the primary consumers of the data. The submitted code snippets or files were processed by the GPT-4 model, hosted on Azure OpenAI, to identify potential vulnerabilities and generate remediation recommendations. This ensured efficient and accurate processing of the data to meet the project's objectives. Improved web application security streamlined vulnerability remediation, and reduced time and effort for developers.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install footbar.
To install and run the application, follow the instructions below:

1.) Clone the repository using Git:
```bash
https://github.com/omarsiddiqi224/Cyber-Generative-AI.git
```
2.) Install the required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
3.) Get your OpenAI API Key by following these steps:
```bash
Go to OpenAI Website
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Create an account or log in
Navigate to the "API Keys" section
Click on the "Create new secret key" button (or use an existing one)
Copy the API key
```
4.) Create a .env file in the root of the repository directory, and add the following line, replacing <your-api-key> with your actual API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```
5)Run the application using streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
